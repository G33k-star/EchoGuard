# Intro to Engineering Course Project: # EchoGuard
This project was created and presented for my Intro to Engineering course, building the technical and nontechnical skills needed.

# EchoGuard:
Non-kinetic system that uses mechanical energy, such as ultrasonic waves, to detect the presence, distance, and threat level of an object or person without any physical contact. This can be used in an Active Protection System (APS) such as a Trophy system.
